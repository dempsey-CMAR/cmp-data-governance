This website provides technical details on the automated Quality Control tests applied to Water Quality data collected through CMAR's Coastal Monitoring Program.\n\nTo return to CMAR's main Coastal Monitoring Program website page, click [here](https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/).\n\n# Coastal Monitoring Program\n\nCMAR's Coastal Monitoring Program is an ongoing data collection effort to:\n\n- Inform development of coastal industry\n- Guide government policy and management decisions\n- Encourage environmental stewardship\n- Ensure preparedness for climate change\n\n# Water Quality Data\n\nThrough the Water Quality Branch of the Program, CMAR collects temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and depth data using sensors deployed on stationary moorings. Click [here](../pages/cmp_water_quality.qmd) for more information on data collection, sensor calibration and validation, and data access.\n\nClick on a variable in the menu bar above for more detailed information about the variable, CMAR measurements, and quality control thresholds. \n\n# Quality Control\n\nAutomated Quality Control tests have been applied to the data to identify outlying and unexpected observations. Click [here](../pages/qc_tests.qmd) to learn more about the Quality Control tests applied to the Water Quality data.\n\n# Data Products\n\nCoastal Monitoring Program Water Quality Data can be accessed from several platforms. Summary reports are available on the [CMAR Website](https://cmar.ca/reports/). [Full datasets](../pages/cmp_data_products.qmd) can be downloaded from the [Nova Scotia Open Data Portal](https://data.novascotia.ca/browse?tags=coastal+monitoring+program) and the [CIOOS Atlantic](https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/organization/cmar).\n\nThe reports and datasets can also be accessed through the CMAR [Station Locations Map](https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/#station).\n\n# Code\n\nCMAR has developed and maintains a suite of packages in R (free, open-source statistical software) to facilitate processing Coastal Monitoring Program data. Water Quality data was compiled using the [`sensorstrings`](https://github.com/dempsey-CMAR/sensorstrings) package. Quality Control flags were applied using the [`qaqcmar`](https://github.com/dempsey-CMAR/qaqcmar) package. Both packages can be viewed or installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/dempsey-CMAR).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/hex_stickers.png){fig-align='center' width=386}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Note\n\nThe CMAR Data Governance Website is under development. Content is being added and revised.\n\n\n",
