<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="depth">Depth</h2>
<p>The placement of the temperature sensors depends on the depth of the water at each station. Typically, sensors are fastened 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 m below the surface at low tide. At deeper stations, additional sensors are added every 5 - 10 m. At shallow stations, sensors maybe be attached nearer to the surface (<a href="#fig-temp-n-obs-depth">Figure&nbsp;3</a>).</p>
<p>Sensors may be placed at other depths for technical reasons or specific research projects (e.g., investigation of the oxycline in Whycocomagh Basin).</p>

<p>Some of these sensors also measure other variables including dissolved oxygen, salinity, depth, and acoustic detections.</p>
<p>The Vemco VR2AR is typically the deepest sensor, anchored about 0.5 m above the sea floor. It has an acoustic release that is triggered to retrieve the sensor string. Deployments without VR2AR sensors are usually accessible from the surface, but some are retrieved by dragging or divers.</p>
