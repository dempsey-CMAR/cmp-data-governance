A typical sensor string configuration consists of a rope attached to the seafloor by an anchor and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths (@fig-sensor-string). Most strings deployed since 2018 are attached to the anchor by an acoustic receiver with a release mechanism. The receiver also logs detections of tagged animals including great white sharks, sturgeon, and tuna for the [Ocean Tracking Network](https://oceantrackingnetwork.org/).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Diagram of a typical sensor string configuration (not to scale).](figures/sensor_string2.png){#fig-sensor-string fig-align='center' width=487}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCharacteristics of the station location[^1] and stakeholder needs dictate \nthe string design[^2]. Sensor strings are generally deployed 200 m to 1000 m from shore, in depths up to 75 m. Historically, strings were deployed with only temperature sensors, but in more recent years at least one dissolved oxygen sensor is included (typically at 5 m). At the request of industry, salinity sensors are also included at stations near proposed and existing shellfish aquaculture leases. Some of the sensors used to measure these variables also measure sensor depth. CMAR has also processed and published this opportunistic depth data.\n\n\n\n[^1]: e.g., depth, bottom type, and currents\n[^2]: e.g., anchor weight, and number/type of sensors\n\nThe different sensor string configurations are described in the table below and (@fig-sensor-string-configs):\n\n|  |  |\n|---|------------|\n|     sub-surface buoy    |     Attached to sub-surface buoy. Typically has an acoustic release, but sometimes retrieved by diver or drag line. Does not float with tide.    |\n|     surface buoy    |     Attached to surface buoy. Floats with tide.    |\n|     attached to gear    |     Typically attached to aquaculture gear, but may be attached to another structure. Floats with tide.    |\n|     attached to fixed structure    |     Attached to wharf, bridge, or pole. Does not float with tide.    |\n|     floating dock    |     Attached to a floating dock. Floats with tide.    |\n|     unknown    |     Configuration not indicated in deployment log.    |\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Diagram of different sensor string configuration (not to scale).](figures/sensor_string_configurations.png){#fig-sensor-string-configs fig-align='center' width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Sensor Calibration & Validation\n\n## Pre-Deployment Validation\n\nPrior to deployment, sensors that can be calibrated are calibrated according to their specific sensor manual. All sensors are then subjected to a Validation Test(s), which differ depending on the variables measured. \n\n### Dissolved Oxygen (percent saturation)\nFor a Validation Test of dissolved oxygen measured in units of percent saturation, sensors are set to record at 15 minute intervals and placed in an air-tight environment with water-saturated air at 100 % humidity. The sensors are left to record for at least 6 hours (@fig-bucket).\n\n![Four aquaMeasure DOT sensors in a sealed dissolved oxygen validation test bucket.](figures/bucket2.jpg){#fig-bucket}\n\nThe precision for these dissolved oxygen sensors is +/-5 % [@RN26880]. Since the the sensors in the bucket are in water-saturated air, they should measure 100 +/-5 % saturation. Any sensors outside of the acceptable 95 - 105 % range for more than 10 % of the test are re-calibrated and re-validated. A sensor that fails 2 consecutive validation tests is sent to the manufacturer for maintenance.\n\n![Observations from a  dissolved oxygen (percent saturation) Validation Test of 4 sensors. The gray band indicates the acceptable range of values.](figures/do_calval.png){#fig-do_calval}\n\n@fig-do_calval shows the results of a dissolved oxygen Validation Test for four sensors. Sensor #675016 recorded outside of an acceptable range for 99.9% of the test period, and was therefore flagged for re-calibration.\n\n### Other Variables\n\nFor Validation Tests of the other variables, sensors are set to record at 10 - 15 minute intervals and submerged in a well insulated container of water for at least 6 hours. Seawater is used for tests with salinity sensors. \n\nAfter the recording period, data from all sensors is offloaded. Each observation is compared to the median value of all sensors in the container. Sensors with > 10 % of measurements outside of the acceptable range indicated in the sensor manual are re-validated. A sensor that fails 2 consecutive validation tests is sent to the manufacturer for maintenance. \n\n![Four aquaMeasure DOT sensors, 3 hobo sensors, and 1 VR2AR sensor submerged in water in a cooler for a validation test.](figures/val_cooler3.jpg){#fig-cooler}\n\nAll code used to evaluate sensor validation test status are published in CMAR’s R package [calval](https://github.com/ntorrie/calval).\n\n## Post-Deployment Validation\n\nRetrieved sensors undergo a post-deployment validation test, which follows the same procedures as the pre-deployment validation test. The post-deployment tests identify sensors that drifted, were impacted by biofouling, or were damaged. \n\n# Data Access\n\nCoastal Monitoring Program Water Quality Data can be accessed from several platforms. Summary reports are available on the [CMAR Website](https://cmar.ca/reports/). Full datasets can be downloaded from the [Nova Scotia Open Data Portal](https://data.novascotia.ca/browse?tags=coastal+monitoring+program) and the [CIOOS Atlantic](https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/organization/cmar).\n\nThe reports and datasets can also be accessed through the CMAR [Station Locations Map](https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/#station).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/data_access.png){fig-align='center' width=2200}\n:::\n:::\n",
