Intro blurb about test

- From QARTOD manuals
- Provide codeable instructions
- Data providers must determine thresholds
- Include table here of ones that we are actually using?

## Gross Range Test

The Gross Range Test aims to flag observations that fall outside of the sensor measurement range (flagged [Fail]{style="color: #DB4325;"}) and observations that are statistical outliers (flagged [Suspect/Of Interest]{style="color: #EDA247;"}).

Thresholds for [failed]{style="color: #DB4325;"} observations are named $sensor_{min}$ and $sesnor_{max}$, and are determined by the sensor specifications. CMAR named assigned these thresholds for each variable and sensor based on information in the associated manuals.

Thresholds for [suspect/of interest]{style="color: #EDA247;"} observations are named $user_{min}$$ and $$user_{max}$, and are defined by the data provider. CMAR assigned these thresholds based on historical Coastal Monitoring Program data.

Following the [OOI Biogeochemical Sensor Data: Best Practices & User Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19pS5V1hsKAcSaGjwfmyrmZRIJFMXNAc4B0Uo9Akvmd4/edit#heading=h.u87btnaapb66), **these thresholds were calculated from historical data as the mean +/- three standard deviations** (@eq-user-min, @eq-user-max):

$$
user_{min} = avg_{var} - 3 * stdev_{var}  
$$ {#eq-user-min}

$$
user_{max} = avg_{var} + 3 * stdev_{var}
$$ {#eq-user-max}

where $avg_{var}$ is average of the variable of interest, and $stdev_{var}$ is the standard deviation of the variable of interest.

- **depending on variable, grouped by county or not. Didn't group by depth**

## Climatological Test

The Climatological Test is a variation of the Gross Range Test that accounts for seasonal variability. There is no [Fail]{style="color: #DB4325;"} flag associated with this test for temperature, salinity, or dissolved oxygen due to the dynamic nature of these variables [@RN24432;@RN26562]. Observations that are seasonal outliers were assigned the flag [Suspect/Of Interest]{style="color: #EDA247;"}.

These thresholds are named $season_{min}$ and $season_{max}$. The seasonal time period (e.g., monthly, seasonally, other) and associated thresholds are defined by the data provider. Following the [OOI Biogeochemical Sensor Data: Best Practices & User Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19pS5V1hsKAcSaGjwfmyrmZRIJFMXNAc4B0Uo9Akvmd4/edit#heading=h.u87btnaapb66), seasons were defined based on the calendar month, and the thresholds were based on historical data. The monthly thresholds were defined similar to the Gross Range Test:

$$
season_{min} = avg_{season} - 3 * stdev_{season}  
$$ {#eq-season-min}

$$
season_{max} = avg_{season} + 3 * stdev_{season}  
$$ {#eq-season-max}

The $avg_{season}$ was calculated as the average of all observations for a given month, and $stdev_{season}$ was the associated standard deviation. 

Note that OOI used a more complex method (harmonic analysis, as described [here](https://github.com/oceanobservatories/qc-lookup)) to estimate $avg_{season}$ to account for spurious values. This was beyond the current scope of the CMAR Coastal Monitoring Program, but could be applied in future iterations of this threshold analysis.
