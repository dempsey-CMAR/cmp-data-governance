    "text": "DRAFT April 14, 2023\nAlthough it is beyond the OOI scope to produce their own analysis-ready data products for the BGC sensors, OOI does undertake initial data processing as well as some basic QA/QC.\nTo ensure high-quality data products, the Centre for Marine Applied Research applies automated and “human in the loop” quality control (QC) processes to the Coastal Monitoring Program data.\nAn automated QC test is an algorithm that evaluates each data record and assigns a flag to the record indicating the test results. These flags are typically reviewed by human experts, which is referred to as “human in the loop” QC. End users can then filter the data set for records that meet their quality criteria (UNESCO 2013).\nNumerous QC tests and flagging schemes exist and have been applied to oceanographic data sets [e.g., Appendix A in UNESCO (2013); OOI ref as example of different tests]. CMAR has adopted the well-known QARTOD tests and flagging scheme, which is applied by the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) and other ocean observing entities (see Table 1 of IOOS 2020a).\nQARTOD stands for the “Quality Assurance / Quality Control of Real-Time Oceanographic Data”. It is a project that grew from a 2003 grassroots effort to develop guidelines for high-quality oceanographic data. From 2012 to 2019, QARTOD developed 13 Quality Control manuals covering 14 ocean variables, plus additional supporting materials (IOOS 2020a). Each QC manual is subjected to three iterations of formal review by subject-matter experts, with the final round soliciting international reviews. Published manuals are updated as needed to reflect new technology, additional knowledge, or growth of the Project (IOOS 2020a).\nThe QARTOD flag scheme has 5 levels, as described in Table 1.\n\n\nTable 1: QARTOD flag scheme (IOOS 2020b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPass - 1\nData have passed critical real-time quality control tests and are deemed adequate for use as preliminary data.\n\n\nNot evaluated - 2\nData have not been QC-tested, or the information on quality is not available.\n\n\nSuspect or Of High Interest- 3\nData are considered to be either suspect or of high interest to data providers and users. They are flagged suspect to draw further attention to them by operators.\n\n\nFail - 4\nData are considered to have failed one or more critical real-time QC checks. If they are disseminated at all, it should be readily apparent that they are not of acceptable quality.\n\n\nMissing data - 9\nData are missing; used as a placeholder.\n\n\n\n\nQARTOD manuals define QC tests for the 14 variables. For each variable, the tests are grouped into three categories: Required, Strongly Recommended, and Suggested. The Required tests provide the minimum level of QC, and should be easy to implement. However, it is recognized that there are circumstances where these tests are not applicable (IOOS 2020b). Codable instructions are included with the description of each test to facilitate implementation of automated data checking (IOOS 2020a).\nQARTOD manuals focus on QC of real-time data (e.g., minimal delay from when data are recorded to when they are ready for use; however, it is acknowledged that other data may benefit from QARTOD QC (IOOS 2020b). The CMAR Coastal Monitoring Program Water Quality Data is not processed in real-time. Instead, data is logged by individual sensors, and typically offloaded for processing every 6 - 12 months. Some QARTOD tests were therefore not applicable to this data, and it was necessary and / or advantageous to modify some of the tests to reflect the nature of the data processing. More detail on these changes is provided in the appropriate sections below.\nQC tests require thresholds that determine the results of the test. For example, records greater than the maximum value that can be recorded by a sensor should fail a simple maximum value test. Choosing appropriate thresholds for each test and variable is a key part of the QC effort. The operator (data provider) is responsible for selecting thresholds for QARTOD tests, and thresholds should be based on historical data when possible [IOOS (2020b); (RN15382?); add ooi].\nThis document describes the tests applied for each variable, and the methods for selecting the most appropriate thresholds. Where possible, these thresholds were determined from historical data, which provide a baseline of “normal” and “outlying” conditions. The historical data used here was the Coastal Monitoring Program Water Quality data sets submitted to the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal in December 2022. Preliminary quality control measures (e.g., obvious outliers and suspected biofouling removed) were applied to these datasets before submission. Additionally, freshwater and other outlier stations were excluded from the threshold analysis to provide a better representation of “normal” conditions.\nThese thresholds should be re-evaluated and re-calculated if necessary in several years, when more data is available.\nadd test table here\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nIOOS. 2020a. “QARTOD - Prospects for Real-Time Quality Control Manuals, How to Create Them, and a Vision for Advanced Implementation.” https://doi.org/10.25923/ysj8-5n28.\n\n\n———. 2020b. “QARTOD Manual for Real-Time Oceanographic Data Quality Control Flags.” https://cdn.ioos.noaa.gov/media/2020/07/QARTOD-Data-Flags-Manual_version1.2final.pdf.\n\n\nUNESCO. 2013. “Recommendation for a Quality Flag Scheme for the Exchange of Oceanographic and Marine Meteorological Data.”"
