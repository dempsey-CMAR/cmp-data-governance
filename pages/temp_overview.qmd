Temperature is a key driver of biological and physical components of the marine ecosystem. 

Ocean temperature is a critical parameter for marine life, influencing physiological processes, species distribution, and species abundance [@RN12876]. Warming temperatures have been linked to individual and population-level changes in fish species, including decreased body size [@RN13690] and population expansion or shifts towards cooler, deeper waters [@RN13620; @RN7236]. For example, several species typically associated with warm waters south of Nova Scotia are now considered “well established” on the Scotian Shelf (e.g., the blackbelly rosefish; *Helicolenus dactylopterus*), and it is expected that more warm water species will become established as temperatures increase [@RN15387].

Temperature is directly related to ocean stratification, which refers to vertical layers of water with similar properties (e.g., temperature and salinity). Upper ocean stratification is seasonal, with a warm fresh layer developing in the spring and summer[^1] and disappearing in the fall and winter[^2]. This process brings heat and carbon dioxide into deeper waters, and transports nutrients from deep waters to the euphotic zone, supporting the base of the food web [@RN13951]. There is evidence that stratification in some regions of Atlantic Canada is increasing due to changes in temperature and salinity [@RN15284]. Increased stratification has implications for climate change (e.g., reduced ability to absorb carbon dioxide) and the ecosystem (e.g., fewer nutrients available for phytoplankton).
