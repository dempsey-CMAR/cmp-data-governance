    "text": "This page provides an overview of where and how sensor depth is measured through the CMAR Coastal Monitoring Program.\nThese figures include data up to the end of the 2022 field season.\n\nLocations\nCMAR has collected depth data from 68 stations in 12 counties (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Approximate location of stations with temperature data.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Observations\n\n\n\nA large proportion of dissolved oxygen records are from Guysborough County (38.68 %) and Shelburne County (14.65 %), while a small proportion are from Colchester (0.43 %) and Annapolis (0.92 %) Counties (Figure 2).\nMost observations to date have been measured in units of percent saturation. In 2021, CMAR began deploying several sensors that record in concentration (mg / L), and there are a growing number of observations recorded in these units (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The number of dissolved oxygen observations in each county.\n\n\n\n\n\nSensors\nCMAR does not deploy sensors specifically to measure depth; however, some of the sensors used to measure other variables also measure depth. Most VR2AR units and some aquaMeasure units (DOTs and SALs) provide depth measurements.\nThe aquaMeasure sensors are programmed to record depth every 10 minutes, and have a precision of 0. 1 m. this typically results in a clear sinusoidal signal that would be expected from tidal changes (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Measured depth observations from an aquaMeasure sensor deployed in January 2020 at Beaver Point.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, the VR2AR units only record depth every hour and have a resolution of 1 m. This results in very coarse depth measurements that don’t clearly show a sinusoidal signal, and can result in apparent spikes (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Measured depth observations from a VR2AR sensor deployed in January 2020 at Beaver Point.\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications\nCMAR takes advantage of the opportunistic depth sampling to verify the estimated depth of sensors on the string in the Depth Crosscheck Test. Abrupt changes in measured depth can indicate that a sensor string was moved during or between deployments. Measured depth that increases over the deployment could indicate substantial biofouling causing the sensors to sink below the intended depth. Measured depth can also provide an estimate of the tidal range in an area."
