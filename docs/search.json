All sensors are then subjected to a Validation Test(s), which differ depending on the variables measured.\n\nDissolved Oxygen (percent saturation)\nFor a Validation Test of dissolved oxygen measured in units of percent saturation, sensors are set to record at 15 minute intervals and placed in an air-tight environment with water-saturated air at 100 % humidity. The sensors are left to record for roughly 24 hours (Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Four aquaMeasure DOT sensors in a sealed dissolved oxygen validation test bucket.\n\n\nThe precision for these dissolved oxygen sensors is +/-5 % (InnovaSea 2021). Since the the sensors in the bucket are in water-saturated air, they should measure 100 +/-5 % saturation. Any sensors outside of the acceptable 95 - 105 % range for more than 10 % of the test require re-calibration.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Observations from a dissolved oxygen (percent saturation) Validation Test of 4 sensors. The gray band indicates the acceptable range of values.\n\n\nFigure 3 shows the results of a dissolved oxygen Validation Test for four sensors. Sensor #675016 recorded outside of an acceptable range for 99.9% of the test period, and was therefore flagged for re-calibration.\n\n\nOther Variables\nFor Validation Tests of temperature and dissolved oxygen measured in mg/L, sensors are set to record at 10 - 15 minute intervals and submerged in a well insulated, circulating tank of fresh water for roughly 24 hours. The same procedure is used for the salinity Validation Tests, except seawater is used instead of fresh water.\nUpon completion of the Validation Tests, data from each sensor is offloaded and evaluated to ensure all sensors are recording within an appropriate manufacturer-specified range of each other. Sensors that pass the tests are cleared for deployment. Any sensor that records outside of the acceptable range for ≥ 10 % of the test will be re-calibrated (if applicable) and re-validated. If a sensor fails more than 2 consecutive validation tests it will be sent back to the manufacturer.\nAll code used to evaluate sensor validation test status are published in CMAR’s R package calval."

Most VR2AR units and some aquaMeasure units (DOTs and SALs) provide depth measurements.\nThe aquaMeasure sensors are programmed to record depth every 10 minutes, and have a precision of 0.1 m. this typically results in a clear sinusoidal signal that would be expected from tidal changes (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Measured depth observations from an aquaMeasure sensor deployed in January 2020 at Beaver Point.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, the VR2AR units only record depth every hour and have a resolution of 1 m.

Abrupt changes in measured depth can indicate that a sensor string was moved during or between deployments. Measured depth that increases over the deployment could indicate substantial biofouling causing the sensors to sink below the intended depth. Measured depth can also provide an estimate of the tidal range in an area."

    "text": "Ocean properties including temperature, salinity, oxygen and nutrient availability, circulation, and primary production are linked to depth (Bundy et al. 2014). The water column becomes stratified when layers of water with different densities (e.g., temperature, salinity) form on top of each other and limit mixing. Typically, less dense water layers sit on top of more dense layers.\nLight availability is one of the primary drivers for photosynthesis in the ocean. As depth increases, light availability decreases and photosynthetic rates decline (Webb 2021). The ocean can be coarsely divided into three depth zones characterized by how much light they receive (NOAA, n.d.):\n\nEuphotic Zone (0 - 200 m depth): Sunlight penetrates to sufficiently support growth of phytoplankton and/or macro algae and provide the majority of the ocean primary production.\nDysphotic Zone (200 - 1,000 m depth): Also known as the twilight zone, the light penetration is minimal. Biomass density is lower than the Euphotic Zone.\nAphotic Zone (1,000+ m depth): Sunlight does not penetrate. Low biomass, food is generally scarce.\n\nCoastal ocean depth at a given location depends on seafloor bathymetry, the tidal cycle, and storm surges from extreme events. While bathymetric changes for a given location typically only occur on a larger geologic time scale, the tidal cycle and storm surges have more short-term impacts on depth. The tidal influence on depth varies by location. For example, the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia is home to the largest tides in the world, with a 14.5 metre depth difference between high and low tide at the head of the bay (Bundy et al. 2014). On the eastern shore of the Province, the tidal range is closer to 1-2 meters (Bundy et al. 2014). Storm surges and wind-driven waves from extreme weather events in Nova Scotia can add an additional 2 meters or more of depth in the short term (Canada 2022; Boyer 2003).\nOcean depth can be measured in a variety of ways. Sonar (SOund NAvigation and Ranging) uses sound waves (NOAA 2023a), while lidar (LIght Detection and Ranging) uses lasers to create high-resolution images of the seafloor (NOAA 2023b). Many oceanographic sensors can measure depth using a pressure sensor. Pressure is recorded and then converted to depth using sensor software (e.g., InnovaSea 2016).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBoyer, Peter. 2003. “Archived: The Storm Surge and Waves at Halifax with Hurricane Juan.” https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/archive/hurricanes/hurricane-juan/storm-summaries/storm-surge.html.\n\n\nBundy, A., D.

At most stations, dissolved oxygen is measured in units of percent saturation. For several stations in Halifax and Lunenburg counties, dissolved oxygen is now recorded in units of concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Observations\n\n\n\nA large proportion of dissolved oxygen records are from Guysborough County (23.37 %) and Shelburne County (20.58 %), while a small proportion are from Antigonish (0.53 %) and Pictou (1.1 %) Counties (Figure 2).\nMost observations to date have been measured in units of percent saturation. In 2021, CMAR began deploying several sensors that record in concentration (mg / L), and there are a growing number of observations recorded in these units (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The number of dissolved oxygen observations in each county.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth\nThere is typically one dissolved oxygen sensor on each sensor string, usually attached 5 m below the surface (Figure 3). This choice of depth reflects the original Coastal Monitoring Program objective, which was to provide data to inform aquaculture site selection1. As the Program and mandate expands, DO sensors continue to be deployed at this depth for consistency and longevity of the time series.\nDissolved oxygen has also been measured at other depths for specific research projects, particularly in Whycocomagh Basin, Inverness County (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Number of dissolved oxygen observations at each depth (rounded to nearest whole number).\n\n\n\n\n\nSensors\nCMAR uses two types of sensors to measure dissolved oxygen: the aquaMeasure DOT (InnovaSea 2021) and Onset HOBO U26 (Onset 2012).\n\naquaMeasure DOT\nCMAR has a large inventory of DOTs (71 in April 2023), which are used for most deployments with dissolved oxygen. The DOT measures temperature and partial pressure of oxygen, providing dissolved oxygen values in units of percent saturation. Partial pressure values are not affected by salinity (Bittig et al. 2018), and so no correction factor is required for these measurements. For CMAR deployments, each DOT is programmed to measure and internally log at 10 minute intervals. CMAR typically retrieves sensors after ~1 year for data offload, cleaning, and calibration/validation.\n\n\nHOBO U26\nCMAR added 13 HOBO U26 sensors to the inventory in 2021, and purchased an additional 10 in January 2023. The HOBO U26 measures temperature the concentration of dissolved oxygen (in units of mg / L). For CMAR deployments, each HOBO U26 is programmed to measure and internally log at 10 minute intervals. These sensors have a sensor cap that needs to be replaced every 6 months. They are deployed in St. Margaret’s Bay and Mahone Bay rather than more remote locations so that they can be serviced twice a year with minimal travel requirements (Figure 1).\nThe HOBO U26 sensor does not account for salinity, so the measurements should be adjusted based on a salinity correction factor before analysis. The HOBOware software can apply this salinity correction if salinity conditions are provided. The software can also convert measured concentration values to percent saturation if salinity and pressure conditions are provided. CMAR does not have consistent salinity or pressure measurements, and so the uncorrected data are provided.\n\n\nBiofouling\nThe DOT and HOBO U26 do not have any anti-fouling mechanisms, and so measurements are susceptible to biofouling. Ideally, sensors would be cleaned every 2 - 4 weeks to remove fouling, but this is not feasible due to logistical and financial constraints. Significant effort was made to flag possible biofouling signals, and CMAR is evaluating potential anti-fouling strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBittig, Henry C., Arne Körtzinger, Craig Neill, Eikbert van Ooijen, Joshua N.

    "text": "Units\nDissolved oxygen can be measured in different units, including concentration and percent saturation (Bittig 2018). For fisheries and aquaculture applications, concentration is often reported in milligrams of gaseous oxygen per litre of water (mg / L) (Bittig et al. 2018), which is equivalent to parts per million (ppm).\nPercent saturation describes how “full” of oxygen the water is (Equation 1). The maximum amount of oxygen that can be dissolved depends on the water temperature, salinity, and barometric pressure (Figure 1, Figure 2). For units of concentration, this theoretical maximum is called the DO solubility, and is typically calculated from equations based on those developed by Benson and Krause (1980, 1984) and Garcia and Gordon (1992)1 Cloern (1999). The percent saturation is the measured DO concentration as fraction of the DO solubility (Equation 1).\n\\[\nDO_{\\%saturation} = 100 * DO_{concentration}/DO_{solubility}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nPercent saturation can also be calculated from partial pressures, although DO is not typically expressed in pressure units (Equation 2). In this case, the maximum amount of DO that can be dissolved is the partial pressure of oxygen in the air (\\(pO_{2, air}\\)), as calculated in SCOR WG 142 (Bittig 2018). The actual amount of DO in the water is measured by the sensor in corresponding pressure units (\\(pO_2\\)).\n\\[\nDO_{\\%saturation} = 100 * pO_2 / pO_{2, air}\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Relationship between DO solubility and temperature at five values of salinity (pressure = 1 atm). Note that DO solubility decreases with increasing temperature and salinity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between DO solubility and temperature at three values of barometric pressure (in freshwater). Note that DO solubility increases with increasing pressure.\n\n\n\n\nConversion between DO units can be non-trivial (Bittig 2018). DO solubility is used to convert between units of concentration and percent saturation, which means estimates of temperature, salinity, and pressure are required. For the most accurate conversion, each DO observation should have a corresponding observation of these water properties. However, this is not always feasible, particularly for long deployments. Single value estimates can be used to convert data from the whole deployment (Onset 2014)."

    "text": "Supersaturation\nWhen the measured DO concentration is greater than the DO solubility (\\(DO_{\\%saturation} > 100 \\%\\)), the water is considered “supersaturated”. Supersaturated water is typically caused by photosynthetic organisms, which are a large source of pure oxygen to the water column (YSI 2019; Craig and Hayward 1987) 2. Additionally, a rapid increase in temperature can decrease the DO solubility without altering the measured DO concentration, resulting in saturation values greater than 100 %3. The excess DO will eventually diffuse into the atmosphere, but this process is not instantaneous."

    "text": "Biofouling\nA major challenge of accurately measuring DO near the surface4 is the growth of aquatic organisms on and around the sensor, called biofouling (OOI 2022). Biofouling can range from a small film of algae, to large colonies/growths of seaweed, to colonies of mollusks (Figure 3). The daily cycle of photosynthesis (oxygen production during the day) and respiration (oxygen consumption, relatively higher at night) of these organisms can cause extreme variability in the DO measurements. The recorded DO therefore reflects the microcosm growing on the sensor, but not the ambient environment. This signal can occur within a month or two of deployment (OOI 2022), depending on time time of year and location. Other impacts of biofouling can include signal attenuation, sensor drift, and decreased mooring depth from the additional weight (IOOS 2018).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Examples of biofouling on CMAR sensor strings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-fouling strategies can be employed to reduce fouling and improve data quality, although these present other challenges. Sensors can be cleaned regularly to remove growth (e.g., every 2 - 4 weeks), although this may not be feasible for many reasons (e.g., cost and time constraints). Some sensors have built-in anti-fouling mechanisms such as wipers (PME 2023) or UV light (Mariscope 2020) to reduce growth, but these sensors tend to be expensive and have reduced battery life. Copper (a natural biocide) tape, wire, or screens around the sensor can reduce fouling for several weeks, although this can also become expensive and may not be sufficient for longer deployments (YSI 2023)."

There is a broad range of “reasonable” DO values, depending on the location, depth, season, oceanographic conditions, etc. Rapid and extreme variability may reflect the natural processes that are of interest to the monitoring program, including phytoplankton blooms, storms, and upwelling. However, this signal could also be a result of biofouling. To identify the most likely driver, further investigation is required. For example, the timing of the variability with respect to sensor deployment, time of year, and co-located variables could provide insight into the reliability of the measurements. It is also difficult to detect and quantify sensor drift over time for a single deployment. Consecutive deployments at the same station can highlight drift (IOOS 2018)."

    "text": "Salinity impacts both biological and physical components of the ocean ecosystem, including growth rates of marine organisms and vertical stratification Feindel et al. (2013).\nSalinity has direct impacts on marine organisms. Different species and life stages have preferred salinity conditions, outside of which they experience deleterious physiological effects, including mortality (Brennan, Blanchard, and Fennel 2016; Feindel et al. 2013). It is expected that many organisms shift their spatial distribution to avoid poor environmental conditions (Nye et al. 2009), although sessile and cultured organisms have limited to no ability to do so. Salinity is of particular concern for shellfish aquaculture. For example, two cultured species in Nova Scotia (blue mussels and oysters) can tolerate a wide range of salinity for short periods of time, but prolonged exposure to low salinity1 can result in reduced growth and reproduction, higher disease prevalence, and eventually death (Feindel et al. 2013; Howarth, Coughlin, and Reid 2021).\nLike temperature, salinity is directly related to seasonal ocean stratification. Freshwater inputs in the spring and summer contribute to a fresh, warm surface layer that disappears in the fall and winter from wind-driven mixing. In turn, salinity is impacted by rates of evaporation and precipitation, freshwater inputs, melting and freezing of sea ice, and ocean circulation (Environment and Canada 2019). Remote sensing observations of salinity, along with temperature and chlorophyll-a, can also be used to estimate ocean acidification (Land et al. 2015; Salisbury et al. 2015).\nSurface waters around Canada, including off the coast of Nova Scotia, are generally becoming fresher due to climate change and natural variability (Environment and Canada 2019). This trend is expected to continue as a result of the projected increase in precipitation and ice melt (Environment and Canada 2019; Howarth, Coughlin, and Reid 2021). In contrast, deep waters in the Gulf of St. Lawrence are becoming more saline as a result of the northward shift in subtropical currents bringing in saltier waters (Environment and Canada 2019; Howarth, Coughlin, and Reid 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBrennan, Catherine E., Hannah Blanchard, and Katja Fennel. 2016. “Putting Temperature and Oxygen Thresholds of Marine Animals in Context of Environmental Change: A Regional Perspective for the Scotian Shelf and Gulf of St. Lawrence.” Journal Article.

    "text": "This page provides an overview of where and how dissolved oxygen is measured through the CMAR Coastal Monitoring Program.\nThese figures and values include data collected up to the end of the 2022 field season and subjected to preliminary Quality Control.\n\nLocations\nCMAR has collected temperature data from 126 stations in 15 counties (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Approximate location of stations with temperature data.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Observations\n\n\n\nA large proportion of these records are from Guysborough County (37.24 %), while a small proportion are from Cape Breton (0.11 %) and Colchester (0.6 %) Counties (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The number of temperature observations in each county.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth\nThe placement of the temperature sensors depends on the depth of the water at each station. Typically, sensors are fastened 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 m below the surface at low tide. At deeper stations, additional sensors are added every 5 - 10 m. At shallow stations, sensors maybe be attached nearer to the surface (Figure 3).\nSensors may be placed at other depths for technical reasons or specific research projects (e.g., investigation of the oxycline in Whycocomagh Basin).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Number of temperature observations at each depth (rounded to nearest whole number).\n\n\n\n\n\nSensors\nCMAR uses several types of sensors to measure temperature (Table 1):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of these sensors also measure other variables including dissolved oxygen, salinity, depth, and acoustic detections.\nThe Vemco VR2AR is typically the deepest sensor, anchored about 0.5 m above the sea floor. It has an acoustic release that is triggered to retrieve the sensor string. Deployments without VR2AR sensors are usually accessible from the surface, but some are retrieved by dragging or divers."

    "text": "Temperature is a key driver of biological and physical components of the marine ecosystem.\nOcean temperature is a critical parameter for marine life, influencing physiological processes, species distribution, and species abundance (Canada 2016). Warming temperatures have been linked to individual and population-level changes in fish species, including decreased body size (Baudron et al. 2013) and population expansion or shifts towards cooler, deeper waters (Nye et al. 2009; Shackell, Ricard, and Stortini 2014). For example, several species typically associated with warm waters south of Nova Scotia are now considered “well established” on the Scotian Shelf (e.g., the blackbelly rosefish; Helicolenus dactylopterus), and it is expected that more warm water species will become established as temperatures increase (Fisheries and Canada 2020).\nTemperature is directly related to ocean stratification, which refers to vertical layers of water with similar properties (e.g., temperature and salinity). Upper ocean stratification is seasonal, with a warm fresh layer developing in the spring and summer1 and disappearing in the fall and winter2. This process brings heat and carbon dioxide into deeper waters, and transports nutrients from deep waters to the euphotic zone, supporting the base of the food web (Environment and Canada 2019). There is evidence that stratification in some regions of Atlantic Canada is increasing due to changes in temperature and salinity (Hebert et al. 2021). Increased stratification has implications for climate change (e.g., reduced ability to absorb carbon dioxide) and the ecosystem (e.g., fewer nutrients available for phytoplankton).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBaudron, Alan, Coby Needle, Adriaan Rijnsdorp, and C.

    "text": "Temperature thresholds were calculated from the historical Coastal Monitoring Program data. Preliminary quality control was applied to this data, and obvious outliers and data from freshwater stations were omitted.\nSeparate thresholds were calculated for each county due to expected and observed spatial differences in temperature (Figure 1; Figure 2).\nIn the future, it may be useful to resolve temperature thresholds by depth as well as county (or smaller spatial scales). However, the data become very patchy when grouped by depth, which could result in less useful thresholds values. Additionally, the same depth can represent a different part of the water column for different stations. For example, at the Barren Island station in Guysborough County, the 15 m sensor is near the bottom. In contrast, 15 m is in the top 20 % of the water column at Tickle Island, another station in Guysborough County."
