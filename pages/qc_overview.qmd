# Quality Control

CMAR applies automated and "human in the loop" quality control (QC) processes to the Coastal Monitoring Program Water Quality data. 

Note that it is beyond the scope of the Program to produce analysis-ready data products for all potential users, and some users may wish to apply additional QC.


## Quality Control Tests

An automated QC test is an algorithm that evaluates each data record and assigns a flag to the record indicating the test results. These flags are typically reviewed by human experts, which is referred to as "human in the loop" QC. End users can then filter the data set for records that meet their quality criteria [@RN26831].

Numerous QC flagging schemes and tests exist and have been applied to oceanographic data sets [e.g., Appendix A in @RN26831]. CMAR has adopted the well-known QARTOD flag scheme and several QARTOD tests, which are applied by the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) and other ocean observing entities [see Table 1 of @RN25921].

## QARTOD Guidance

QARTOD stands for the ["Quality Assurance / Quality Control of Real-Time Oceanographic Data"](https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/qartod/). It is a project that grew from a 2003 effort to develop guidelines for high-quality oceanographic data. QARTOD has developed 13 Quality Control manuals covering 14 ocean variables, plus additional supporting materials [@RN25921]. Each QC manual is subjected to three iterations of formal review by subject-matter experts, with the final round soliciting international reviews. Published manuals are updated as needed to reflect new technology, additional knowledge, or growth of the Project [@RN25921].

QARTOD manuals focus on QC of real-time data[^1], but acknowledge that other data types may also benefit from these flags and tests [@RN25922]. The CMAR Coastal Monitoring Program data is not processed in real-time[^2]. Instead, data is logged and offloaded from the sensors for processing every 6 - 12 months. Some QARTOD guidance was therefore not applicable to this data, and procedures were adapted to reflect the nature of CMAR data and processing.

## Flag Scheme

CMAR has adopted the QARTOD flag scheme (@tbl-qartod-flags) with minor adaptations. Details on how the QARTOD flag scheme was developed is provided in @RN26831. 

| **Flag**                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Pass - 1]{style="color: #009200;"}                       | [Data have passed critical real-time quality control tests and are deemed adequate for use as preliminary data.]{style="color: #009200;"}                                                                       |
| [Not evaluated - 2]{style="color: #c4c1a5;"}              | [Data have not been QC-tested, or the information on quality is not available.]{style="color: #c4c1a5;"}                                                                                                        |
| [Suspect or Of High Interest- 3]{style="color: #EDA247;"} | [Data are considered to be either suspect or of high interest to data providers and users. They are flagged suspect to draw further attention to them by operators.]{style="color: #EDA247;"}                   |
| [Fail - 4]{style="color: #DB4325;"}                       | [Data are considered to have failed one or more critical real-time QC checks. If they are disseminated at all, it should be readily apparent that they are not of acceptable quality.]{style="color: #DB4325;"} |
| [Missing data - 9]{style="color: #5A5A5A;"}               | [Data are missing; used as a placeholder.]{style="color: #5A5A5A;"}                                                     |

: QARTOD flag scheme [@RN25922]. {#tbl-qartod-flags}

The main CMAR adaptation to this flag scheme is that the [Missing data]{style="color: #5A5A5A;"} flag is not used. This flag is meant to alert real-time operators that an expected observation was not received, and may trigger efforts to fix recording and transmission issues. Since CMAR does not receive real-time data, this placeholder flag was deemed unnecessary. Note that data gaps may still occur due to sensor failure, delays between retrieval and re-deployment, and vandalism. It is the responsibility of the data users to identify and address these data gaps if required.

Note that QARTOD uses a flag of [3]{style="color: #EDA247;"} to denote observations that are [Suspect]{style="color: #EDA247;"} (e.g., of dubious quality) **or** [Of High Interest]{style="color: #EDA247;"} (e.g., an unusual event). This is meant to encourage human in the loop decisions making [@RN25922]. Where possible, CMAR has defined when these test results are likely [Suspect]{style="color: #EDA247;"} vs. [Of High Interest]{style="color: #EDA247;"}, although data users should inspect these records carefully before deciding how to use (or discard) them.

## Tests

As of February 2024, CMAR applies 5 QC tests to the Coastal Monitoring Program Water Quality data (@tbl-cmar_tests). Click [here](../pages/qc_tests.qmd) for more detail on each test,

| Test | Description | Reference |
|---|-----|---|
| Gross Range | Flags observations that fall outside of the sensor measurement range and observations that are statistical outliers. | @RN26562, @RN24432 |
| Climatology  | Flags observations that are statistical outliers for a given month. | @RN26562, @RN24432, @RN26877 |
| Spike | Flags single-value spikes. | @RN26562, @RN24432 |
| Rolling Standard Deviation | Flags observations with statistically high rolling standard deviation (e.g., multiple-value spikes). | CMAR |
| Depth Crosscheck[^3] | Flags deployments where the sensor depth at low tide is different from the measured depth at low tide. | CMAR |

[^3]: note that this is a deployment-level test. See [here](../pages/qc_tests.qmd) for more information.


## Thresholds

Each QC test requires threshold(s) that determine the results of the test. Choosing appropriate thresholds for each test and variable is a key part of the QC effort. Following best practices, CMAR has developed thresholds based on historical data where possible [@RN25922; @RN15382; @RN26877]. The [QC Tests](../pages/qc_tests.qmd) page provides an overview of each QC test and how the associated thresholds were calculated. The Thresholds page under each variable in the menu above provides additional details on how the threshold(s) were determined.
