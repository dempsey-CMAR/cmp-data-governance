title: "Thresholds Analysis"
---

This document describes the tests applied for each variable, and the methods for selecting the most appropriate thresholds. Where possible, these thresholds were determined from historical data, which provide a baseline of "normal" and "outlying" conditions. The historical data used here was the Coastal Monitoring Program Water Quality data sets submitted to the [Nova Scotia Open Data Portal](https://data.novascotia.ca/browse?q=coastal%20monitoring&sortBy=relevance) in December 2022. Preliminary quality control measures (e.g., obvious outliers and suspected biofouling removed) were applied to these datasets before submission. Additionally, freshwater and other outlier stations were excluded from the threshold analysis to provide a better representation of "normal" conditions.

These thresholds should be re-evaluated and re-calculated if necessary in several years, when more data is available.
