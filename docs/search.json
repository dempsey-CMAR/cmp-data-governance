    "text": "Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a measure of the amount of gaseous oxygen dissolved in water, which is a key water quality parameter for much aquatic life (Santana et al. 2017). There are many drivers of DO variability, including biological activity (e.g., photosynthesis, respiration, plankton blooms), physical processes (e.g., air-sea exchange, tidal events, meteorology, seasonal stratification), and chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation of organic material) (Santana et al. 2017; IOOS 2018). DO is typically higher near the surface, where it is produced by photosynthetic organisms and is in flux to maintain equilibrium with the atmosphere (refs). DO is distributed to deeper waters by vertical mixing and diffusion."

    "text": "Units\nDissolved oxygen can be measured in different units, including concentration and percent saturation (Bittig 2018). For fisheries and aquaculture applications, concentration is often reported in milligrams of gaseous oxygen per litre of water (mg / L) (Bittig et al. 2018), which is equivalent to parts per million (ppm).\nPercent saturation describes how “full” of oxygen the water is (Equation 1). The maximum amount of oxygen that can be dissolved depends on the water temperature, salinity, and barometric pressure (Figure 1, Figure 2). For units of concentration, this theoretical maximum is called the DO solubility, and is typically calculated from equations based on those developed by Benson and Krause (1980, 1984) and Garcia and Gordon (1992)1 Cloern (1999). The percent saturation is the measured DO concentration as fraction of the DO solubility (Equation 1).\n\\[\nDO_{\\%saturation} = 100 * DO_{concentration}/DO_{solubility}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nPercent saturation can also be calculated from partial pressures, although DO is not typically expressed in pressure units (Equation 2). In this case, the maximum amount of DO that can be dissolved is the partial pressure of oxygen in the air (\\(pO_{2, air}\\)), as calculated in SCOR WG 142 (Bittig 2018). The actual amount of DO in the water is measured by the sensor in corresponding pressure units (\\(pO_2\\)).\n\\[\nDO_{\\%saturation} = 100 * pO_2 / pO_{2, air}\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Relationship between DO solubility and temperature at five values of salinity (pressure = 1 atm). Note that DO solubility decreases with increasing temperature and salinity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between DO solubility and temperature at three values of barometric pressure (in freshwater). Note that DO solubility increases with increasing pressure.\n\n\n\n\nConversion between DO units can be non-trivial (Bittig 2018). DO solubility is used to convert between units of concentration and percent saturation, which means estimates of temperature, salinity, and pressure are required. For the most accurate conversion, each DO observation should have a corresponding observation of these water properties. However, this is not always feasible, particularly for long deployments. Single value estimates can be used to convert data from the whole deployment (refs)"

    "text": "Supersaturation\nWhen the measured DO concentration is greater than the DO solubility (\\(DO_{\\%saturation} > 100 \\%\\)), the water is considered “supersaturated”. Supersaturated water is typically caused by photosynthetic organisms, which are a large source of pure oxygen to the water column (YSI (2019); Craig and Hayward (1987))2. Additionally, a rapid increase in temperature can decrease the DO solubility without altering the measured DO concentration, resulting in saturation values greater than 100 %3. The excess DO will eventually diffuse into the atmosphere, but this process is not instantaneous (ref)."

    "section": "Biofouling",
    "text": "Biofouling\nA major challenge of accurately measuring DO near the surface4 is the growth of aquatic organisms on and around the sensor, called biofouling (OOI 2022). Biofouling can range from a small film of algae, to large colonies/growths of seaweed, to colonies of mollusks Insert CMAR photos. The daily cycle of photosynthesis (oxygen production during the day) and respiration (oxygen consumption, relatively higher at night) of these organisms can cause extreme variability in the DO measurements. The recorded DO therefore reflects the microcosm growing on the sensor, but not the ambient environment. This signal can occur within a month or two of deployment (OOI 2022), depending on time time of year and location. Other impacts of biofouling can include signal attenuation, sensor drift, and decreased mooring depth from the additional weight (IOOS 2018).\nAnti-fouling strategies can be employed to reduce fouling and improve data quality, although these present other challenges. Sensors can be cleaned regularly to remove growth (e.g., every 2 - 4 weeks), although this may not be feasible for many reasons (e.g., cost and time constraints). Some sensors have built-in anti-fouling mechanisms such as wipers (PME 2023) or UV light (Mariscope 2020) to reduce growth, but these sensors tend to be expensive and have reduced battery life. Copper (a natural biocide) tape, wire, or screens around the sensor can reduce fouling for several weeks, although this can also become expensive and may not be sufficient for longer deployments (YSI 2023)."

    "text": "Other Challenges\nQuality control of DO data can also be challenging and time consuming. There is a broad range of “reasonable” DO values, depending on the location, depth, season, oceanographic conditions, etc. Rapid and extreme variability may reflect the natural processes that are of interest to the monitoring program, including phytoplankton blooms, storms, and upwelling. However, this signal could also be a result of biofouling. To identify the most likely driver, further investigation is required. For example, the timing of the variability with respect to sensor deployment, time of year, and co-located variables could provide insight into the reliability of the measurements. It is also difficult to detect and quantify sensor drift over time for a single deployment. Consecutive deployments at the same station can highlight drift (IOOS 2018)."

These flags are typically reviewed by human experts, which is referred to as “human in the loop” QC.

CMAR has adopted the well-known QARTOD flags and tests, which are applied by the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) and other ocean observing entities (see Table 1 of IOOS 2020a)."

    "text": "QARTOD\nQARTOD stands for the “Quality Assurance / Quality Control of Real-Time Oceanographic Data”. It is a project that grew from a 2003 grassroots effort to develop guidelines for high-quality oceanographic data. From 2012 to 2019, QARTOD developed 13 Quality Control manuals covering 14 ocean variables, plus additional supporting materials (IOOS 2020a). Each QC manual is subjected to three iterations of formal review by subject-matter experts, with the final round soliciting international reviews. Published manuals are updated as needed to reflect new technology, additional knowledge, or growth of the Project (IOOS 2020a).\n\nFlag Scheme\nThe QARTOD flag scheme has 5 levels, as described in Table 1. More detail on how this flag scheme was developed is provided in UNESCO (2013).\n\n\nTable 1: QARTOD flag scheme (IOOS 2020b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPass - 1\nData have passed critical real-time quality control tests and are deemed adequate for use as preliminary data.\n\n\nNot evaluated - 2\nData have not been QC-tested, or the information on quality is not available.\n\n\nSuspect or Of High Interest- 3\nData are considered to be either suspect or of high interest to data providers and users. They are flagged suspect to draw further attention to them by operators.\n\n\nFail - 4\nData are considered to have failed one or more critical real-time QC checks. If they are disseminated at all, it should be readily apparent that they are not of acceptable quality.\n\n\nMissing data - 9\nData are missing; used as a placeholder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTests\nQARTOD manuals define QC tests for the 14 variables. For each variable, the tests are grouped into three categories: Required, Strongly Recommended, and Suggested. The Required tests provide the minimum level of QC, and should be easy to implement. However, it is recognized that there are circumstances where these tests are not applicable (IOOS 2020b). Codable instructions are included with the description of each test to facilitate implementation of automated data checking (IOOS 2020a).\n\n\nTable 2: QARTOD tests for temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen (IOOS 2020c, 2018).\n\n\nRequired\nTest 1\nGap Test\n\n\nRequired\nTest 2\nSyntax Test\n\n\nRequired\nTest 3\nLocation Test\n\n\nRequired\nTest 4\nGross Range Test\n\n\nRequired\nTest 5\nClimatological Test\n\n\nStrongly Recommended\nTest 6\nSpike Test\n\n\nStrongly Recommended\nTest 7\nRate of Change Test\n\n\nStrongly Recommended\nTest 8\nFlat Line Test\n\n\nSuggested\nTest 9\nMulti-Variate Test\n\n\nSuggested\nTest 10\nAttenuated Signal Test\n\n\nSuggested\nTest 11\nNeighbor Test\n\n\nSuggested1\nTest 12\nTS Curve/Space Test\n\n\nSuggested2\nTest 13\nDensity Inversion Test\n\n\n\n\nQARTOD manuals focus on QC of real-time data3, although the manuals acknowledge that other data types may also benefit from these flags and tests (IOOS 2020b). The CMAR Coastal Monitoring Program data is not processed in real-time. Instead, data is logged and offloaded for processing every 6 - 12 months. Some QARTOD tests were therefore not applicable to this data, and it was necessary and / or advantageous to modify some tests to reflect the nature of the data and processing.\nFor example, Test 1 and Test 2 are meant to identify gaps and syntax errors in real time so that the errors can be fixed and the record resume. They are therefore not applicable to the Coastal Monitoring Program data sets and were not implemented. Most of the remaining Required and Implemented tests were applied, but the Suggested tests are beyond the capacity of the current Data Governance team. These additional tests could be implemented in the future.\n\n\nThresholds\nQC tests require thresholds that determine the results of the test. Choosing appropriate thresholds for each test and variable is a key part of the QC effort. The operator (data provider) is responsible for selecting thresholds for QARTOD tests, and thresholds should be based on historical data when possible (IOOS 2020b; Taylor and Loescher 2013; OOI 2022)."

Preliminary quality control measures (e.g., obvious outliers and suspected biofouling removed) were applied to these datasets before submission. Additionally, freshwater and other outlier stations were excluded from the threshold analysis to provide a better representation of “normal” conditions.\nThese thresholds should be re-evaluated and re-calculated if necessary in several years, when more data is available."
